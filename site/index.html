            <h2>Beginning of Vonic Terror Raids</h2>
            <h3>200-1-07</h3>
            <!-- <h2 style="color:#D62828; margin-top: -1em;">---------------</h2> -->
            <p>With the Jantan and Burnsville forces clashing in the southern part of the continent, some members of the Northern Vonan Tribes began to make their voices heard as well. The raids would be quick events where Vonan warriors would descend onto lesser-defended Burnsville posts or villages. Stealing as much as they could carry, then setting the target(s) on fire to cover their retreat.</p>

            <h2>Gattersberg Renovation</h2>
            <h3>200-1-02</h3>
            <!-- <h2 style="color:#D62828; margin-top: -1em;">---------------</h2> -->
            <p>Six years after the Gattersberg Pyre, the former city had rebuilt the majority of itself from the blaze. To commemorate the 6th anniversary of the disaster, the city hosted another fair similar to the one going on during the events of the fire six years ago.</p>

            <h2>Jantan Unification</h2>
            <h3>197-2-32</h3>
            <!-- <h2 style="color:#D62828; margin-top: -1em;">---------------</h2> -->
            <p>While the Jantan residents met the Burnsville occupation of their city with resistance from the beginning, the Unification marks the first time that Jantans began cohesively organizing against the larger military force. On this date seven different groups of Jantans participated in coordinated strikes against Burnsville forces, driving them out of the city and swamp regions near the town. This would escalate the occupation into a full-scale war between the two civilizations.</p>

            <h2>Burnsville Military Occupation of Janta</h2>
            <h3>194-1-56</h3>
            <!-- <h2 style="color:#D62828; margin-top: -1em;">---------------</h2> -->
            <p>After the fallout of the Gattersberg Pyre, evidence was found to suggest actors originating in the city of Janta were to blame. Janta had long been a place of lawlessness, so a unanimous vote was passed by the Federation Council to stage a military occupation on the city to find those responsible.</p>

            <h2>The Gattersberg Fire</h2>
            <h3>194-1-02</h3>
            <!-- <h2 style="color:#D62828; margin-top: -1em;">---------------</h2> -->
            <p>Nikoli Daedala was in Gattersberg on business from the Burnsville Federal Council. Gattersberg was rich in mineral resources needed for Nikoli's experimental combustion fuel. The Archivist (Blake Andersen) had come with Mina Serphent on contract from the the Olivers to discuss getting a copy of Nikoli's designs of his combustion engine.</p>
            <p>After an unfruitful introduction, the negociations turned sour when Blake attempted to steal the designs off the inventor's workbench, starting a fight between the inventor and the Archivist. After being knocked back into a crate of paper and other supplies, Nikoli's hightened bodyheat started a fire, which quickly spread to the other tables and objects in the room.</p>
            <p>The fire quickly spread to other parts of the building, and ignighted a fuel silo. In the explosion, debris flew to other buildings and the fire quickly spread across the city. It took four days for authorities to contain the blaze. In that time nine people were confirmed dead, with over fourty suffering severe burnings.</p>

            <!-- <h2 style="color:#D62828; margin-top: -1em;">---------------</h2> -->
            <p>The Archivist's first funded expedition outside of Federation territory. Although well prepared to deal with a variety of beasts and other threats, only the Archivist came back weeks later with reports of powerful magic and horrifying entities.</p>

            <h2>Colsemare Flood</h2>
            <h3>182-4-58</h3>
            <!-- <h2 style="color:#D62828; margin-top: -1em;">---------------</h2> -->
            <p>The village of Colesmare was a small town settled into the North-East border of of the Drownlands, between the plains, the river, and the swamp itself. In the winter of 182 FS, an ice-dam broke, and a large wave of icy water swept through the area, destroying the village with over half of it's population.</p>
