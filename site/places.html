            <p>The Burnsville Federation is the shining beacon of mankind and it's innovative triumph over nature. The capitol city Burnsville itself is the center for technological innovations and research in the Meylands, and through federating contracts with other cities, the enlightenment is expanding, and the destiny of mankind is made manifest!</p>

            <h2>The Galewoods</h2>
            <!-- <h2 style="color:#D62828; margin-top: -1em;">---------------</h2> -->
            <p>The Galewoods are a large forest taking up the eastern edge of the continent. The Galewoods themselves are very sparsely documented, mostly in legend. Although some tribes do live within, formal expeditions from Burnsville or other parties has had little success due to dense populations of monsters. Reports suggest a strong magical precense, enough to interfere with electronic systems</p>

            <img src="images/long_walkers.jpg">
            <p>A large marsh region in the south-west of the continent. Sinkholes and changing terrain make mapping the area difficult, but it is navigable thanks to cooperation of more experienced, nomadic long-walkers.</p>
