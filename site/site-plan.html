        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>         
        The main page will be used to describe events in the world. Things like timelines, stories, or other things going on in the world.
      </p>

      <h3>Characters</h3>
      <p>         
        The characters page will have different cards for each character, featuring a picture and a short description.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/wireframe-characters.png" alt="characters/bio page">

      <h3>Places</h3>
      <p>         
        The places will be similar to the characters page, but photos will be landscape shots or maps instead of portraits, and their description will have more history associated with the place.

        Content

      <p>
        I have content for the site, but it would be unreasonable to put all of it down in the plan. I've taken exerpts from each section and an image to place here. The images aren't mine, but I've been using them as visual references.</p>

        The Meylands is a continent lush full of magical beasts, horrifying monsters, expanding nation states, and ancient secrets.

        Since the beginning, man had feared the beasts of the world. They built up cities and forts with walls to protect against nature's hostility. This was until a man by the name of Nikoli Daedala invented the steam engine.

        Harnessing the power of fire, steam and steel: humanity was finally able to push back out into the frontiers against the forces of the wilds. Humanity spread out farther than ever before, and yet because of the advancing technology, was more interconnected than ever before. Some building new cities, others venturing out, exploring and learning from the Wilds.

        Now, 25 years after the invention that shook the world, another evolution of technology was in the works as Daedala and the Burnsville Federation engineers sought to redefine the limits of possibility once again. In the east, the Wilds themselves begin to rear back against man's intrusion into their depths

        "The Archivist" is a historian, hunter, and Burnish scholar renowned for his research across the Meylands. Perhaps the foremost expert on pre-Burnsville lore and archaeology in the world, his work is the subject of scandal in the west, and of debate in the east. He has been known to take a more "hands-on" approach to his research, having stolen from royal archives, disturbed tombs, and conversed with speaking beasts over the course of his career. His exact identity remains unknown to most, but is often described as a tall, Yenuvan man with short-cut hair. Wearing a long travel-coat, worn boots, and a nose for secrets.
